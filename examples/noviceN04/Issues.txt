 - incosistent parameters in Tubs/TGeoTubeSegment:
    phistart,deltaPhi vs phi0, phi1
   
  - question: which xml tags are used/allowed  
   (e.g. tubs. phi0, phi1 ...)

 - specifying materials in xml:
   would like to write:
     <material name="ArgonGas" z="18." a="39.95*g/mole" density="1.782*mg/cm3"/>
   which is close to geant4:
     Ar=new G4Material("ArgonGas",z=18., a= 39.95*g/mole, density=1.782*mg/cm3);
   -> does not work (right now)

 - vis attribute wireframe="true" does not seem to work



 - original G4VSensitiveDetector classes are not yet used in DD4hep port
   => need to change DDG4/Geant4SensitiveDetector ....

   -> exampleN04 does not yet work (crashes due to missing SDs)
